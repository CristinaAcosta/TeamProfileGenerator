## Description:
Here I created a webpage for employeers to add Engineers, Interns or Managers to their teams. They are then prompted to answer a series of questions in the terminal to determine their names, emails, and IDs. They intern is asked their school, the manager is asked their office number, and the engineer is asked their github account. All this is then displayed on a full roster to showcase the whole team. 

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- OOP
- NPM Inquirer 

## Things learned:
I was able to re learn node and how to create a prompt function but being able to do this in a constructor as well. I had a hard time figuiring out how to import the file to an html. The error messages on terminal were really confusing as to where the problem was. My tests also failed and I could not figure out why.
